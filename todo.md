 **Goal: Draw a 10x10 grid of randomly colored squares on your canvas.**

What you need to figure out (look these up one at a time as you need them):

How to set the width and height of a canvas element
How to get a reference to your canvas in JavaScript (hint: research document.getElementById or document.querySelector) - **GetElement**
How to get the 2D rendering context from a canvas (this is what lets you actually draw) - **Canvas.getContext**
What method draws a filled rectangle on canvas - **FillRect**
How to generate a random number between 0-255 (for RGB color values)
How to create an RGB color string in JavaScript
How to use nested loops to create a grid pattern

Break it down into steps:
Step 1: Just get ONE square to appear on the canvas (any color, any position)
Step 2: Make that square's color random
Step 3: Draw a row of 10 squares
Step 4: Draw 10 rows
Search terms to use:

"canvas getContext 2D"
"canvas fillRect method"
"JavaScript random number between range"
"JavaScript nested for loops"

Don't try to do it all at once. Get step 1 working first, then move to step 2.
